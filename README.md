# Notes

The algorithm is not finished, if I had more than 4 hours I would make definitely unit tests for GetTaxForDay( ) to continue working on it but I prioritized setting up the project, handling inputs and output, refactoring and setting up a scalable codebase.

Also I unfortunately tried for 1.5hrs to get a solution for different days of the year since the example showed (the note on the desk) had different days until I saw the docs on the CongestionTaxCalculator class saying the calculation was only for a single day. So I was not sure if the solution was for the whole year or a single day.
